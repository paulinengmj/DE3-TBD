DE3 Robotics The Butterfly Director


This is the documentation of The Butterfly Director (TBD) group, for the Imperial College London, Design Engineering Third Year (DE3), Robotics module (March 2020).

Drawing inspiration from light painting images, this project entails programming the Franka Emika robotic arm to draw several still images of a butterfly with light to produce a stop motion animation.

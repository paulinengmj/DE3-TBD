## Successful Achievements

#### Final Video
Overall the group is very pleased with the outcome of the project. A video of the final butterfly animation that was produced by the robot can be seen at the link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzkP2c_H80Q&feature=youtu.be). This took approximately 30 minutes to create.

#### What Went Well

- The final output video that was created is very similar to the theoretical animation created at the start of the project fully validating the human-computer-robot-reality flow of the system.

- The final system is adaptable for different animations that may be created in the future.

- People like the animation that was created and are curious as to how it was achieved.

- The robot can create animations very quickly. The time taken to draw each frame of the butterfly is 10-15 seconds. The main time used is just waiting for the camera to process the image so using a better camera could save even more time.

- The final code is very simple to understand, as it was broken down into separate functions, and offers a good base to build upon for future developments.

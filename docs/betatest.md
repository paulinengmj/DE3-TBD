## Lo-Fi Beta Testing
**********
To validate the concept, a beta test was first conducted without the robotic arm. In this experiment, a human, an iPhone torch, a template, a stand, a camera and a tripod were used.

The template was rotated at approximately 20&deg; intervals through 180&deg;, pivoting on the stand. At each rotation, a long exposure image was taken on the camera and the human moved the light around the frame. Once this sequence was complete, the images were manually compiled in a video editing software to create the beta test animation.

## Summary
Drawing inspiration from light painting images, this project entails programming the Franka Emika robotic arm to draw several still images of a butterfly with light to produce a stop motion animation. The Franka Emika Panda was used as it can move very precisely making it suitable for recreating small details in 3D images.

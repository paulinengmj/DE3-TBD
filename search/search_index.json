The final code is available on GitHub here . Code Structure There are two main python files which are used to get the panda robot to light paint. - pandaLightPaint is the main python file which is executed from ROS to carry out motion planning for each frame of the animation and then executes this motion plan by moving the end effector and controlling the gripper position. - frames is the python file in which the cartesian based trajectory is stored for a complete animation. This is imported by pandaLightPaint and informs the motion plan which is calculated. Main Code (pandaLightPaint) The main python code that is launched from the terminal. Set Up First, the required python modules are imported, ensure that all of these are installed in your python installation within ROS. Note ROS specific modules such as different message formats which allow communication between nodes. #!/usr/bin/env python #ROS specific import sys import copy import rospy import moveit_commander import moveit_msgs.msg import geometry_msgs.msg from std_msgs.msg import String, Float64MultiArray, MultiArrayDimension, Float64 from moveit_commander.conversions import pose_to_list Next, the generic python packages are imported. math.pi is required for robot angle calculations which are based in radians from math import pi import tf Finally, the list framelist is imported from the frames python file which is stored alongside pandaLightPaint from frames import framelist Modifiable variables These are the variables which can be changed to modify the behaviour of the robot. Some of these are useful to modify when troubleshooting for problems as they can often help prevent errors. The offset coordinates are the cartesian coordinates in metres of the starting position for all frame drawing. The frame coordinates, in framelist, are provided w.r.t to a central local origin point. In the case of the butterfly, this is the centre of its body. The offset coordinated oOffCords specify the location of the frames local coordinate system relative to the robots coordinate system which has an origin located at the base of the arm. By default, the offset coordinates are set to 0.5 metres in front of the robot(x-axis) and 0.5 metres height above the base of the robot(z-axis). This always for a good amount of redundancy when drawing frames as the arm is well within the dexterous workspace. oOffCords = [0.5,0,0.5] The offset rotation specifies the desired pitch, roll and yaw of the end effector during light painting. When motion planning this is added as a constraint to ensure the end effector is always facing in the same direction. This means that the light will always be facing towards the camera and prevents distortion of the frame draw. By default, this is set to a pitch of pi radians and yaw of -pi/4 radians which correspond to custom torch attachment facing directly forward. These values can be changed if the camera is positioned differently. oOffRots = [pi,0,-pi/4] The shake angle simply specified the angle in radians by which the end effector will be offset in yaw during the shake manoeuvre. Generally, this will not need to be changed unless you want the shake to be fast in which case the angle should be reduced. shakeAngle = pi/8 Frame Scale is used to adjust the dimensions of the frames within framelist for the animation. Depending on the unit of scale for the animation the frame coordinates need to be scaled to fit with the dexterous workspace of the robot. If the coordinate is outside the workspace then there will either be a motion planning error or the robot will fail to execute the motion plan. In this, the framescale should be reduced to ensure all coordinates are within the acceptable range. Generally, the framescale can be determined by finding the value of the largest coordinate then choosing a framescale which multiplies this value to equal 0.3. This ensures that the frame will all be drawn within a 0.6-metre sized box with its centre and the position of the offset coordinate. framescale = 0.3 / Largest Coordinate This value is not automatically calculated as users may want to experiment with drawing larger frames or drawing smaller frames to save time. Additionally, if multiple frames files are used it may be required that these are all scaled by the same value. frameScale = 0.004 Processing time is simply the length of time in seconds between the drawing of each frame. This allows time for the camera to process the long exposure photo. This value can be changed to suit the processing time for whichever camera is being used. processingTime = 20 Light on and light off distances are the distances in metres which the end effector grabber will open and close to when turning the light on and off during frame drawing. The default values work well for the custom end effector light specified in this documentation. If a different torch design is used these values can be changed as required. lightOnDist = 0.03 lightOffDist = 0.05 Main Execution Set Up This is the main section of the code which is executed when the program is launched from the terminal. It includes the initial set up as the main loop which is responsible for drawing each frame. To begin with rospy a new node is created for the panda light controller. Next, the motion planing is initialised with the group name being assigned. rospy.init_node('panda_light_paint_controller', anonymous=True) #Initialise motion planning in RVIZ moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv) robot = moveit_commander.RobotCommander() scene = moveit_commander.PlanningSceneInterface() group_name = \"panda_arm\" group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander(group_name) A publisher is created for the controlling the gripper. The message format for the gripper is also specified as a 2d array of float values. gripper_publisher = rospy.Publisher('/franka/gripper_position_controller/command', Float64MultiArray, queue_size=1) gripper_msg = Float64MultiArray() # gripper_msg.layout.dim = [MultiArrayDimension('', 2, 1)] Finally the goToPose function is called to set up the robot in it's starting configuration with the end effector at the offset positition at the offset rotation values. goToPose(oOffRots[0],oOffRots[1],oOffRots[2],oOffCords[0],oOffCords[1],oOffCords[2]) Main Execution Loop The main execution loop will be carried out for each frame of the animation in framelist. Each time this loop is executed a frame will be drawn. The loop starts with a terminal message informing the user to open the shutter on the camera. Next, the lightOn function is called which closes the grippers to turn on the torch held by panda. The goOnPath function is executed which draws one frame of the animation. The light is then turned off and a terminal message is printed informing the user to end the current photo. Finally, a delay is carried out to allow time for the camera to process the image before the next frame. for frame in framelist: #User inform message to start photo print(\"Open Shutter\") #Turn on the light by closing the end effector lightOn() #Wait 1 second rospy.sleep(1) #Execute frame motion goOnPath(frame) #Turn off the light by opening the end effector lightOff() #User inform message to end photo print(\"Close Shutter\") #Wait time so that camera has enough time to process image before next frame rospy.sleep(processingTime) goToPose Function This function takes the input arguments roll, pitch and yaw, as well as x,y and z coordinates, and will calculate and execute a motion plan to get the robot in the correct pose. This is done by first clearing the old pose targets. Then converting the rotation values into a quaternion which is used to set the new values for the origin pose (which is the target pose). The motion plan is then calculated and executed. If a motion plan cant be found for the chosen pose values and an error message will be displayed in the terminal. def goToPose(roll,pitch,yaw,xCord,yCord,zCord): group.clear_pose_targets() quaternion = tf.transformations.quaternion_from_euler(roll, pitch, yaw) origin_pose = geometry_msgs.msg.Pose() origin_pose.orientation.x = quaternion[0] origin_pose.orientation.y = quaternion[1] origin_pose.orientation.z = quaternion[2] origin_pose.orientation.w = quaternion[3] origin_pose.position.x = xCord origin_pose.position.y = yCord origin_pose.position.z = zCord group.set_pose_target(origin_pose) plan = group.go(wait=True) shakeHand Function This function will execute a number of handshakes specified by the quantity input argument. These handshakes can be used to indicate the start and end of frames to the user when operating the robot if the terminal is not visible by the camera operator. This function can deal with invalid input arguments and will only execute if the integer of the input quantity is greater than 0. An error message will be displayed for invalid input. def shakeHand(quantity): quantity = int(quantity) #Check if the quanitty value is valid, if not print error message if (quantity >=1): for i in range (quantity): goToPose(oOffRots[0],oOffRots[1],oOffRots[2]-shakeAngle,oOffCords[0],oOffCords[1],oOffCords[2]) goToPose(oOffRots[0],oOffRots[1],oOffRots[2]+shakeAngle,oOffCords[0],oOffCords[1],oOffCords[2]) goToPose(oOffRots[0],oOffRots[1],oOffRots[2],oOffCords[0],oOffCords[1],oOffCords[2]) else: print(\"Shake not executed. Shake quantity value needs to be a positive integer\") goOnPath Function This function takes a frame of coordinates, as it's input argument, and then executes the drawing of the frame by calculating a motion plan and executing it on the robot. This function works similarly to the goToPose function, however, group.compute_cartesian_path is used to calculate the motion plan as the trajectory is based upon multiple coordinates. The coordinates that make up a frame are converted into drawpose values inside the for loop and these are then added to the list of poses called drawpoints. The motion plan is calculated based on this list of robot poses. def goOnPath(frame): #Clear previous pose targets group.clear_pose_targets() #Create an empty list to store the frame coordinates drawpoints = [] for coordinate in frame: #Calculate the quaternion of the end effector facing forward quaternion = tf.transformations.quaternion_from_euler(oOffRots[0],oOffRots[1],oOffRots[2]) #Initialise the drawpose message drawpose = geometry_msgs.msg.Pose() #update the drawpose message base upon the required rotation and coordinate location of the end effector drawpose.orientation.x = quaternion[0] drawpose.orientation.y = quaternion[1] drawpose.orientation.z = quaternion[2] drawpose.orientation.w = quaternion[3] drawpose.position.x = oOffCords[0] + coordinate[0] *frameScale drawpose.position.y = oOffCords[1] + coordinate[1] *frameScale drawpose.position.z = oOffCords[2] + coordinate[2] *frameScale #Add the drawpose message to the list of drawpoints drawpoints.append(copy.deepcopy(drawpose)) #Calculate motion path base on drawpoints list (plan, fraction) = group.compute_cartesian_path(drawpoints, 0.01, 0.0) #Execute the calculated motion plan and wait until complete group.execute(plan, wait=True) lightOn Function This function will turn on the light attached to the end effector by closing the gripper based upon the value set in the lightOnDist variable. def lightOn(): gripper_msg.data = [lightOnDist, lightOnDist] gripper_publisher.publish(gripper_msg) lightOff Function This function will turn off the light attached to the end effector by opening the gripper based upon the value set in the lightOffDist variable. def lightOff(): gripper_msg.data = [lightOffDist, lightOffDist] gripper_publisher.publish(gripper_msg) Storing Animation (frames) The animation frames are stored in the framelist in the python file frames. This is the output data from the animation creation process in Rhino. Each frame is comprised of a list of 3 value lists which contain a coordinate value [x,y,z]. Multiple frames make up an animation sequence. An example of one frame from the butterfly animation can be seen below. framelist = [[[0, 0, 0], [-30.112995, 0, 4.267024], [-29.869165, 0, -5.730003], [0, 0, 0], [19.752333, 0, 5.902996], [20.161001, 0, -3.087721], [0, 0, 0], [-26.639191, -9.011853, -26.175182], [26.034624, -20.905941, -26.17518], [0, 0, 0], [-26.639191, 9.011853, -26.175182], [26.034624, 20.905941, -26.17518], [0, 0, 0.1]]]","title":"Code Development"},{"location":"CodeDevelopement/#code-development","text":"This section talks about how the final python code works and why it is set up in this way.

Automating Image Capture This could be implemented through designing a custom shutter with a large surface area connected to the camera. The shutter could then be pressed by the robot in-between frames to open and close the aperture before and at the end of the motion. Another option could be to use an infrared sensor which the robot would need to swipe over, this would require less advanced hardware and could prevent damage to robot due to collision. The robot operating sequence would in turn change with this setup, removing the need for a wiggle indication and shifting the priority towards turning the light on and off with the gripper preventing a streak in each frame. Image Compilation This would be impossible using the current hardware available since the images are stored in an SD card on the camera. A way for the stop motion animation to be automatically compiled is by using a Raspberry Pi with a camera module. This can be implemented by appending each image to a sequence of images followed by a command to export it as a video. This would, therefore, allow the images to be automatically compiled as an animation at the end of the robot operating sequence. Speed Control The intensity of the light in an image is proportional to the time spent in each position ie. speed, s ; the brightness of the torch, bt ; and angle of motion relative to the orbiting camera angle, a which varies sinusoidally, from maximum when a=0 . Image brightness, B = (k* bt + x* sin(a))/ s Where k and x are constants.

Do NOT uninstall ROS or libfranka on workstations which already have it installed . Getting started This section details how to connect the robot and test the setup by using FCI to read the current state. Operating the robot Before going further though, here are a few safety considerations. Always check the following things before powering on the robot: Make sure that the arm has been mounted on a stable base and cannot topple over, even when performing fast motions or abrupt stops. Caution Only tabletop mounting is supported, i.e. the Arm must be mounted perpendicular to the ground! Other mountings will void your warranty and might cause damage to the robot! Ensure that the cable connecting Arm and Control is firmly attached on both sides. Connect the external activation device to Arm\u2019s base and keep it next to you in order to be able to stop the robot at any time. Hint Activating the external activation device will disconnect the Arm from Control. The joint motor controllers will then hold their current position. The external activation device is not an emergency stop! This list is non-exhaustive! The manual delivered with your robot contains a chapter dedicated to safety. Please read it carefully and follow the instructions. Important The workstation PC which commands your robot using the FCI must always be connected to the LAN port of Control (shop floor network) and not to the LAN port of the Arm (robot network). Setting up the network Good network performance is crucial when controlling the robot using FCI. Therefore it is strongly recommended to use a direct connection between the workstation PC and Panda\u2019s Control. This section describes how to configure your network for this use case. _images/control.png Use Control\u2019s LAN port when controlling the robot through FCI. Do not connect to the port in Arm\u2019s base. The Control and your workstation must be configured to appear on the same network. Simplest way to achieve that is to use static IP addresses. Any two addresses on the same network would work, but the following values will be used for the purpose of this tutorial: Workstation PC Control Address 172.16.0.1 172.16.0.2 Netmask 24 24 The Control\u2019s address (172.16.0.2) is called in the following chapters.

The configuration process consists of two steps: Configuring Control\u2019s network settings. Configuring your workstation\u2019s network settings. Control network configuration For this step, the robot needs to be installed and tested. Please read through the documents shipped with your robot and follow the setup instructions before continuing any further! The Control\u2019s network can be configured in the administrator\u2019s interface. For the duration of this step you can connect to the robot through the port in the robot\u2019s base. For details, consult the Connecting a user interface device section in the manual delivered with your robot. _images/accessing-admin.png Accessing the administrator\u2019s interface through Desk. To set up a static address, enter the following values in the Network section: _images/control-static-ip.png Setting a static IP for the Control\u2019s LAN port (Shop Floor network).

Linux workstation network configuration This section describes how to set up a static IP address on Ubuntu 16.04 using the GUI. Follow the official Ubuntu guide if you prefer to use the command line. Caution The following steps will modify your network settings. If in doubt, contact your network\u2019s administrator. First, go to Network Connection widget. Select the wired connection you will be using and click edit. _images/edit-connections.png Edit the connection in the Ethernet section. Next, click on the IPv4 settings tab, set the method to Manual, and enter the following values: _images/static-ip-ubuntu.png Setting a static IP for the Workstation PC. Method is set to Manual. Hint This step will disable DHCP, which means you will no longer obtain an address when connecting to a DHCP server, like the one in Arm\u2019s base. When you no longer use FCI, you can change the Method back to Automatic (DHCP). Save the changes, and close the Network Connection window. Click on the connection name from the drop down menu. It should now be possible to connect to the robot from your workstation. To verify this, perform the Network bandwidth, delay and jitter test. From now on, you can also access Desk through this address in your browser. Windows workstation network configuration Setup a static IP address on the Windows workstation. Therefore, open Control Panel and go to Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. Right-click the network adapter and open Properties. Use the same example address and netmask as in the Linux workstation network configuration. Verifying the connection The previous section described how to specify the IP address of the Control\u2019s LAN port. In the following sections that address is referred to as . In order to verify that everything is correctly set up, run the echo_robot_state example from libfranka. If you decided to install franka_ros and libfranka from the ROS repository, you can instead read the instructions for visualizing the robot in ros . Change to the build directory of libfranka and execute the example: Linux: ./examples/echo_robot_state Windows: cd /path/to/libfranka/build/examples/ echo_robot_state.exe Hint Before executing libfranka programms, make sure that the executables are able to find their runtime libraries. On Windows, the easiest way is to copy the needed libraries into the same directory as the executable. The program will print the current state of the robot to the console and terminate after a few iterations. The fields are explained in the libfranka API documentation.

Next, click on the IPv4 settings tab, set the method to Manual, and enter the following values: _images/static-ip-ubuntu.png Setting a static IP for the Workstation PC. Method is set to Manual. Hint This step will disable DHCP, which means you will no longer obtain an address when connecting to a DHCP server, like the one in Arm\u2019s base. When you no longer use FCI, you can change the Method back to Automatic (DHCP). Save the changes, and close the Network Connection window. Click on the connection name from the drop down menu. It should now be possible to connect to the robot from your workstation. To verify this, perform the Network bandwidth, delay and jitter test. From now on, you can also access Desk through this address in your browser. Windows workstation network configuration Setup a static IP address on the Windows workstation. Therefore, open Control Panel and go to Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. Right-click the network adapter and open Properties. Use the same example address and netmask as in the Linux workstation network configuration. Verifying the connection The previous section described how to specify the IP address of the Control\u2019s LAN port. In the following sections that address is referred to as . In order to verify that everything is correctly set up, run the echo_robot_state example from libfranka. If you decided to install franka_ros and libfranka from the ROS repository, you can instead read the instructions for visualizing the robot in ros . Change to the build directory of libfranka and execute the example: Linux: ./examples/echo_robot_state Windows: cd /path/to/libfranka/build/examples/ echo_robot_state.exe Hint Before executing libfranka programms, make sure that the executables are able to find their runtime libraries. On Windows, the easiest way is to copy the needed libraries into the same directory as the executable. The program will print the current state of the robot to the console and terminate after a few iterations. The fields are explained in the libfranka API documentation. Example output: Hint If an error occurs at this point, perform the ping test and ensure that the robot\u2019s fail-safe safety locking system is opened. Further information are provided in the manual shipped with the robot.","title":"Operating the robot"},{"location":"implementation/","text":"Implementation on Panda Setting Up Franka Emika First, release the brakes by making sure the external activation device (EAD) is pressed down.

Image Capture Once the code successfully ran repeatedly on the Panda robot, long-exposure photgraphs were captured of the motion. These photographs were then collated and displayed in sequence to create an animation of a butterfly in flight. Animation Creation The butterfly model was simplified to a low-poly model since it was expected that a large number of frames would be needed to form a smooth animation. I was also intended that the focus was on the animation itself and not on the model. As the project was limited in terms of time with the robot, a simplified outline presented the most opportunity to iterate and increase robotic complexity. I.e. A low fidelity model reduces the amount of time necessary for the robot to complete each frame. Using slow-motion footage of butterflies in flight, one model for each frame of the animation was created in Rhinoceros 3D . The animation was simplified to 11 frames. The angles of the butterfly wings about the x-axis and the z-axis are approximately sinusoidal. A subtle body wiggle was also added, which is a small, random rotation of the two body triangles about the y-axis. (Angles in reference to Figure B axes). NOTE: Note: Grasshopper is a plugin included in Rhino 6, which has built-in functions called \u201ccomponents\u201d to allow for easy data manipulation. These are the steps which can be repeated to output the same result for each frame in Grasshopper: Each of the 4 triangles which form a butterfly were deconstructed into their vertices, faces, colours and normals using the \u201cdeconstruct mesh\u201d components. This outputs as a list of lists; a list of 4 triangles and each triangle having 3 vertices, where each vertex is an xyz coordinate. The repeated centre vertices were removed by putting the lists through the \u201ccreate set\u201d component. Each sublist was extracted using a \u201clist item\u201d components. Reorder the list in such a way that the robot can move from coordinate to coordinate without retracing the same path twice. NOTE: This is important in order to avoid any brighter spots in the animation frames which would be seen as an anomaly. The result is a list of coordinates in curly brackets. Simple data manipulation was then carried out in a text editor to put this in the required python form which uses square brackets (replace function in Wordpad, replacing \u201c{\u201c and \u201c}\u201d for \u201c[\u201c and \u201c]\u201d respectively. This method allows for the flexibility of changing the butterfly animation frame by frame without the need to manually change each coordinate. This would also allow for more complexity to be added easily on the butterfly models (ie. higher poly models), at the cost of a longer per-frame drawing time. The Grasshopper definition shown in Figure C is robust enough to deal with having curved lines, and would output these as a higher number of interpolated points to form the curves. Given more time with the robot, this change could be implemented. Motion Planning Harvey Simulation Motion Planning Simulation Before real-life implementation of the code on the Panda robot, the entire task was tested using RViz and Gazebo simulations. This allowed for all poses and time functions to be tested without the risk of damaging the actual robot. It also made it easier to collaborate on and iteratively improve the code as it was not necessary for each team member to individually access the physical robot. The Panda model was loaded, spawned and placed into the Gazebo environment, then controlled with the Python code written by the group members. Light Painting Simulation By tracing the position of the end effector in RViz, it allowed the path of the attached light-painting module to be recreated in the RViz viewport. This method proved to be much more efficient than camera implementation within Gazebo, which required additional plugins (such as a camera sensor plugin to publish the live image to an image topic and LinkPlot3DPlugin to achieve isolated link tracing) and produced a noisier output due to the shaking exhibited within Gazebo simulations. This effectively generated a digital model of the light painting that the Panda robot would recreate in real life. To initialize the light tracing simulation in RViz, go to: Motion Planning Planned Path Links Check Panda_Hand[_] Check Show Trail [_] Light Source A custom light torch was designed and manufactured to comply towards the dimensions of the Franka Emika end effector gripper.

Image Capture To ensure the light painting will be visible, the surrounding lights should be turned off to increase contrast, while using long exposure photography to capture each frame. The ISO was set to 100 to reduce the graininess of images and a small aperture was used to reduce light entering the camera thus, increasing contrast as well as keeping the entire image in focus (by using a deep depth of field). The camera was mounted on a tripod and an external shutter used to reduce shake during images. The camera was set on \u201cTime\u201d mode, this meant that one press of the shutter would open the aperture and another would close the aperture. Since the duration of motion of the robot arm varied with a frame, this was a simple error-proof method. Before taking photos, the camera was focused on the origin of the end-effector using autofocus and then put on manual focus for the rest of the images. Franka Emika would signal to the human operator to press the shutter by wiggling, at the end of the motion for a frame, the end effector would once again wiggle instructing the end of the previous image and the start of a new frame.","title":"Projectdevelopment"},{"location":"projectdevelopment/#project-development","text":"This section of the documentation consists of the development from animation creation to image capturing","title":"Project Development"},{"location":"projectdevelopment/#method-overview","text":"This project was implemented and segmented into 6 main steps","title":"Method Overview"},{"location":"projectdevelopment/#1-animation-sequencing","text":"The model sequence of the butterfly in flight was generated using Rhinoceros3D and the Grasshopper plugin, iteratvely altering a low-poly mesh to give the effect of a butterfly flapping its wings.","title":"1.

This method proved to be much more efficient than camera implementation within Gazebo, which required additional plugins (such as a camera sensor plugin to publish the live image to an image topic and LinkPlot3DPlugin to achieve isolated link tracing) and produced a noisier output due to the shaking exhibited within Gazebo simulations.

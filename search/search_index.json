Before attempting to light paint using a real robot it is recomended to first get it working in the Gazebo simulator within your virtual machine. This allows you to test your custom animations and verify everything is working without wasting time on a real robot. 1) Downloading Code Once you have completed the previous steps to set up ROS on your computer, with the required modules,you can now use the light painting code in the Gazebo simulator. Up to date files can be found on GitHub at this link https://github.com/HarveyU1/LightPaintingRobot. Download pandaLightPaint.py and frames.py onto your linux virtual machine. 2) Launching Gazebo Open a new terminator window and divide into 6 windows and type in the follwing. In terminal 1 type $roscore In terminal 2 type $cd catkin_ws $cd source devel/setup.bash $rosrun gazebo_ros gazebo In terminal 3 type $cd catkin_ws $source devel/setup.bash $roslaunch franka_gazebo panda_arm_hand.launch You should see that the gazebo simulator has launched and a model of the panda robot can be seen pointing upwards in the environment. 3) Launching MoveIt To launch and set up MoveIt for motion planning do the following In terminal 4 type $cd_catkin_ws $source devel/setup.bash $roslaunch panda_moveit_config demo.launch rviz_tutorial:=true One MoveIt has started add motion planning and change the planning scene topic field to /planning_scene In planning request change planning group to panda_arm 4) Light Trails in MoveIt By tracing the position of the end effector in RViz, it allows the path of the attached light-painting module to be recreated in the RViz viewport which helps when testing new animations. This effectively generates a digital model of the light painting that the Panda robot would recreate in real life. To initialize the light tracing simulation in RViz, go to: 1. Motion Planning 2. Planned Path 3. Links 4. Check Panda_Hand[_] 5. Tick the box Show Trail [_] When the simulation is run in RViz you will see a line which shows the trajectory the end effector will move along. 5) Connect MoveIt to Gazebo To create the node which connects moveIt with Gazebo type the following In terminal 5 type $cd catkin_ws $cd src/panda_publisher $python panda_publisher.py 5) launching pandaLightPaint Everything now set for the simulation so you can launch the pandaLightPaint python code In terminal 6 type $cd catkin_ws cd to the folder you stored the code in $python pandaLightPaint.py The first time you run this you will get some error messages as the robot starts at singularity in the simulation. After about a minute it will find a valid motion plan to get out of singularity. At this point cancel the execution using ctrl c then start the code again. It should now run properly without errors.

I was also intended that the focus was on the animation itself and not on the model. As the project was limited in terms of time with the robot, a simplified outline presented the most opportunity to iterate and increase robotic complexity. I.e. A low fidelity model reduces the amount of time necessary for the robot to complete each frame. Using slow-motion footage of butterflies in flight, one model for each frame of the animation was created in Rhinoceros 3D . The animation was simplified to 11 frames. The angles of the butterfly wings about the x-axis and the z-axis are approximately sinusoidal. A subtle body wiggle was also added, which is a small, random rotation of the two body triangles about the y-axis. (Angles in reference to Figure B axes). NOTE: Note: Grasshopper is a plugin included in Rhino 6, which has built-in functions called \u201ccomponents\u201d to allow for easy data manipulation. Open Rhino 6 Draw an equilateral triangle on the XY plane, with one vertex on the origin. Mirror this triangle through the XZ plane to form the butterfly wings (Mirror command). Draw an isosceles triangle on XZ plane with the vertex corresponding to the smallest angle on the origin. Mirror this triangle through the XY plane to form the butterfly body (Mirror command) Group these 4 triangles (CTRL+G). Copy the group so that there are 11 instances in total (1 for each frame). Isolate each group to its own separate layer (ChangeLayer command) Rotate the wings about the x and z axes in accordance with reference butterfly flight footage incrementally over the 11 frames. Open the Grasshopper plugin. Open the stl_file_to_edges_and_coordinates.gh file in Grasshopper. Right click on the first block in each frame and click 'Set Multiple Meshes'. Select the group in the associated layer. Eg. Layer 1 group for frame 1. Wait for the algorithm to run. Right click on the last block for each frame and select 'Copy Data Only'. Paste the data in your preferred text editor in the correct frame order. Replace all curly brackets with square brackets. Format the data so that it looks like the list in coordinate_list_about-origin.py These are the steps which can be repeated to output the same result for each frame in Grasshopper: Each of the 4 triangles which form a butterfly were deconstructed into their vertices, faces, colours and normals using the \u201cdeconstruct mesh\u201d components. This outputs as a list of lists; a list of 4 triangles and each triangle having 3 vertices, where each vertex is an xyz coordinate. The repeated centre vertices were removed by putting the lists through the \u201ccreate set\u201d component. Each sublist was extracted using a \u201clist item\u201d components. Reorder the list in such a way that the robot can move from coordinate to coordinate without retracing the same path twice. NOTE: This is important in order to avoid any brighter spots in the animation frames which would be seen as an anomaly. The result is a list of coordinates in curly brackets. Simple data manipulation was then carried out in a text editor to put this in the required python form which uses square brackets (replace function in Wordpad, replacing { and } for [ and ] respectively. This method allows for the flexibility of changing the butterfly animation frame by frame without the need to manually change each coordinate. This would also allow for more complexity to be added easily on the butterfly models (ie. higher poly models), at the cost of a longer per-frame drawing time. The Grasshopper definition shown in Figure C is robust enough to deal with having curved lines, and would output these as a higher number of interpolated points to form the curves. Given more time with the robot, this change could be implemented.","title":"Creating Animation"},{"location":"animationcreation/#animation-creation","text":"The butterfly model was simplified to a low-poly model since it was expected that a large number of frames would be needed to form a smooth animation.

However, error detection and recovery could have been built into the code by using Frankx, which is a high-level motion planning library for Franka Emika Panda. Frankx is a python wrapper for Libfranka (which only works in C++), using Reflexes as a trajectory generator, Eigen for transformation calculations and pybind11 for Python bindings. Once installed, the command robot.recover_from_errors() allows the robot to automatically recover from an error by resetting the robot. Missed Opportunities The following section includes missed opportunities that could have been implemented given a longer project time period. Automating Image Capture This could have been implemented through designing a custom shutter with a large surface area connected to the camera. The shutter could then be pressed by the robot in-between frames to open and close the aperture before and at the end of the motion. Another option could be to use an infrared sensor which the robot would need to swipe over, this would require less advanced hardware and could prevent damage of the robot due to collision. The robot operating sequence would in turn change with this setup, without the need for a wiggle indication and to shift the priority towards turning the light on and off with the gripper becoming to prevent a streak in each frame. Image Compilation This was challenging using the hardware available since the images were stored in an SD card. A way for the stop motion animation to be automatically compiled is by using a Raspberry Pi with a camera module. In the code, each image could be appended to a sequence of images and then exported as a video. This would then be able to automatically compile an animation at the end of the robot operating sequence. Speed Control Speed control could have been implemented. The intensity of light in an image was proportional to the time spent in each position (ie. speed, s); brightness of the torch, bt; and angle of motion relative to the orbiting camera angle, a (varying sinusoidally, from maximum when a = 90 degrees, to minimum when a = 0).Image brightness, B = (k bt + x sin(a)) / s Where k and x are constants. Given the above equation, setting B to a constant and defining the pose and position of the camera would mean that the speed could be calculated to maintain a constant brightness in the light trail. Ultimately, however, the images proved to be aesthetic without this, thus it was considered a redundancy. Picking up the torch was executed by directing the robot arm to the correct position and then allowing the torch to snap on using magnets. This assumes that the resting position and pose of the torch is always the same. An opportunity could have been to include computer vision to locate the current position and pose of the torch and then generate a motion plan to pick up the torch. This would have been a more robust method, however, would drastically increase the complexity of the robot by including image processing. Potentially the image processing could be done using a Raspberry Pi camera (same as the one for frame photography) which could provide data to create a motion plan to pick up the torch.","title":"Future Development"},{"location":"evaluation/#outcomes","text":"","title":"Outcomes"},{"location":"evaluation/#error-detection","text":"The chances of error were significantly mitigated by ensuring the motion plan to only be within the workspace of the robot, therefore reducing chances of motion planning error due to collision or being out of the task space.

Image Capture Once the code successfully ran repeatedly on the Panda robot, long-exposure photgraphs were captured of the motion. These photographs were then collated and displayed in sequence to create an animation of a butterfly in flight. Animation Creation The butterfly model was simplified to a low-poly model since it was expected that a large number of frames would be needed to form a smooth animation. I was also intended that the focus was on the animation itself and not on the model. As the project was limited in terms of time with the robot, a simplified outline presented the most opportunity to iterate and increase robotic complexity. I.e. A low fidelity model reduces the amount of time necessary for the robot to complete each frame. Using slow-motion footage of butterflies in flight, one model for each frame of the animation was created in Rhinoceros 3D . The animation was simplified to 11 frames. The angles of the butterfly wings about the x-axis and the z-axis are approximately sinusoidal. A subtle body wiggle was also added, which is a small, random rotation of the two body triangles about the y-axis. (Angles in reference to Figure B axes). NOTE: Note: Grasshopper is a plugin included in Rhino 6, which has built-in functions called \u201ccomponents\u201d to allow for easy data manipulation. These are the steps which can be repeated to output the same result for each frame in Grasshopper: Each of the 4 triangles which form a butterfly were deconstructed into their vertices, faces, colours and normals using the \u201cdeconstruct mesh\u201d components. This outputs as a list of lists; a list of 4 triangles and each triangle having 3 vertices, where each vertex is an xyz coordinate. The repeated centre vertices were removed by putting the lists through the \u201ccreate set\u201d component. Each sublist was extracted using a \u201clist item\u201d components. Reorder the list in such a way that the robot can move from coordinate to coordinate without retracing the same path twice. NOTE: This is important in order to avoid any brighter spots in the animation frames which would be seen as an anomaly. The result is a list of coordinates in curly brackets. Simple data manipulation was then carried out in a text editor to put this in the required python form which uses square brackets (replace function in Wordpad, replacing \u201c{\u201c and \u201c}\u201d for \u201c[\u201c and \u201c]\u201d respectively. This method allows for the flexibility of changing the butterfly animation frame by frame without the need to manually change each coordinate. This would also allow for more complexity to be added easily on the butterfly models (ie. higher poly models), at the cost of a longer per-frame drawing time. The Grasshopper definition shown in Figure C is robust enough to deal with having curved lines, and would output these as a higher number of interpolated points to form the curves. Given more time with the robot, this change could be implemented. Motion Planning Harvey Simulation Motion Planning Simulation Before real-life implementation of the code on the Panda robot, the entire task was tested using RViz and Gazebo simulations. This allowed for all poses and time functions to be tested without the risk of damaging the actual robot. It also made it easier to collaborate on and iteratively improve the code as it was not necessary for each team member to individually access the physical robot. The Panda model was loaded, spawned and placed into the Gazebo environment, then controlled with the Python code written by the group members. Light Painting Simulation By tracing the position of the end effector in RViz, it allowed the path of the attached light-painting module to be recreated in the RViz viewport. This method proved to be much more efficient than camera implementation within Gazebo, which required additional plugins (such as a camera sensor plugin to publish the live image to an image topic and LinkPlot3DPlugin to achieve isolated link tracing) and produced a noisier output due to the shaking exhibited within Gazebo simulations. This effectively generated a digital model of the light painting that the Panda robot would recreate in real life.

Image Capture To ensure the light painting will be visible, the surrounding lights should be turned off to increase contrast, while using long exposure photography to capture each frame. The ISO was set to 100 to reduce the graininess of images and a small aperture was used to reduce light entering the camera thus, increasing contrast as well as keeping the entire image in focus (by using a deep depth of field). The camera was mounted on a tripod and an external shutter used to reduce shake during images. The camera was set on \u201cTime\u201d mode, this meant that one press of the shutter would open the aperture and another would close the aperture. Since the duration of motion of the robot arm varied with a frame, this was a simple error-proof method. Before taking photos, the camera was focused on the origin of the end-effector using autofocus and then put on manual focus for the rest of the images. Franka Emika would signal to the human operator to press the shutter by wiggling, at the end of the motion for a frame, the end effector would once again wiggle instructing the end of the previous image and the start of a new frame.","title":"Projectdevelopment"},{"location":"projectdevelopment/#project-development","text":"This section of the documentation consists of the development from animation creation to image capturing","title":"Project Development"},{"location":"projectdevelopment/#method-overview","text":"This project was implemented and segmented into 6 main steps","title":"Method Overview"},{"location":"projectdevelopment/#1-animation-sequencing","text":"The model sequence of the butterfly in flight was generated using Rhinoceros3D and the Grasshopper plugin, iteratvely altering a low-poly mesh to give the effect of a butterfly flapping its wings.","title":"1.

This allowed for all poses and time functions to be tested without the risk of damaging the actual robot. It also made it easier to collaborate on and iteratively improve the code as it was not necessary for each team member to individually access the physical robot. The Panda model was loaded, spawned and placed into the Gazebo environment, then controlled with the Python code written by the group members.","title":"Motion Planning Simulation"},{"location":"simulation/#light-painting-simulation","text":"By tracing the position of the end effector in RViz, it allowed the path of the attached light-painting module to be recreated in the RViz viewport. This method proved to be much more efficient than camera implementation within Gazebo, which required additional plugins (such as a camera sensor plugin to publish the live image to an image topic and LinkPlot3DPlugin to achieve isolated link tracing) and produced a noisier output due to the shaking exhibited within Gazebo simulations. This effectively generated a digital model of the light painting that the Panda robot would recreate in real life.
